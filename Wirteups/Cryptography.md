From the name of the challenge, i already knew it was a ROT-13 cipher. So i opened up [cyberchef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) and pasted the cipher there and added the ROT13 recipie

Just a quick warm-up cipher for everyone. Honestly, I think it's "a fine" cipher.
```

This is a Affine cipher. i copied it and pasted it on an onlie chipher indentifier [decode.fr](https://www.dcode.fr/cipher-identifier) to be sure of what kind of cipher it is.

After checking up on all the suggested cipher, I found out that it was a Affine cipher. so i was correct

I decoded the the cipher using the same tool https://www.dcode.fr/affine-cipher
